Course Material and FAQ for my Beginner to Advanced HTML5 and CSS3 Course. This repo contains section wise files for the project in the course. Use section wise code for each section, and final code to compare it with your own code whenever something doesn't work!

👇 Presumed FAQs 👇


Q1: How do I download the files? A: If you're new to GitHub and just want to download the entire code, hit the green button saying "Code", and then choose the "Download ZIP" option.

Q2: I'm stuck in one of the topics. Where do I get help? A: Have you actually tried to fix the problem on your own? Have you compared your code to the final code? If you failed fixing your problem, please post a detailed description of the problem to the Q&A area of that video over at Udemy, along with a screenshot. You will get help there. Please don't send me a personal message or email to fix coding problems.

Q3: What VSCode theme are you using? A: I use Dark++ Italic

Q4: Can I see a final version of the course projects? A: Sure, I have an online version of the Synchronize website. You can view it from the following link:

Q5: Videos don't load, can you fix it? A: Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do about it. The course is hosted on Udemy, and sometimes they have technical issues like this. Please just come back a bit later or contact their support team.

Q6: Videos are blurred / have low quality, can you fix it? A: Please open video settings and change the quality from 'Auto' to higher resolutions. If that doesn't help, please contact the Udemy support team.

Q7: Are the videos downloadable? A: No! to avoid piracy, I have disabled the download option

Q8: I want to put the project in my portfolio. Is that allowed? A: Absolutely! Just make sure you actually built them yourself by following the course, and that you understand what you did. What is not allowed is that you create your own course/videos/articles based on this course's content!

Q9: How do I get my certificate of completion? A: A certificate of completion is provided by Udemy after you complete 100% of the course. After completing the course, just click on the "Your progress" indicator in the top right-hand corner of the course page. If you want to change your name on the certificate, please contact the Udemy support team.

Q10: Do you accept pull requests? A: No, for the simple reason that I want this repository to contain the exact same code that is shown in the videos. However, please feel free to add an issue if you found one.
